# Mini_Project_GNITS

Patient Information System is used for keeping a tab on the health recovery, and
degradation of every patient who has ever been to the hospital for treatment. This can be
achieved by building an applet using Java Swing and connecting it to a database of the
patients' information. This project is an attempt to store the information of patients in a
computerized way. It can be a solution to problems related to organization and security of
patients' information.
Java Swing is an API for providing a graphical user interface for Java programs. In this
project, we used Java Swing to build the front end of this applet. Many people visit for
general check ups, surgeries, or for various other problems that they are suffering from. Let
it be during the appointments and registrations, all the data has to be stored in the hospital's
database for maintenance purposes. Using the data provided by the patients, we build a
database to secure all the information which is connected to the Java Swing applet. This
software provides the facility to give a unique id to every patient and also stores the details
of every visitor and the staff automatically. The interface is very user-friendly.
